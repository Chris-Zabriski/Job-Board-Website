App Description:
A webpage built using Node JS that simulates a Job Board. There are a few landing pages and a job board that anybody can see. Anybody can apply to a job by filling
out the application, but they can also register a user that links to their applications. Once a user is registered, they can log in to view the jobs they have applied to.
By putting in the admin credentials, the admin can post a new job, view all applicants, remove a single job, remove all jobs, and remove all applicants. When all jobs
are removed, all applicants are removed as well. There is also a feature so two people can not have the same username.
